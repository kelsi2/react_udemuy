## Possible Future Enhancements

### Expensify App Enhancements

1. Add confirmation modal when removing expense (do you want to delete this? --> See indecision app)
2. Show number of hidden expenses in /dashboard summary (expenses in the past are hidden by default, notify when things are hidden due to filters)
3. Add support for another social login system (GitHub, Facebook, Twitter)
4. Buy a custom domain and configure with Heroku (or use subdomain on domain you own)

### Indecision App Enhancements

1. Deploy to the web like we did with Expensify
